My name is Hanwen Liu. I am a fourth-year PhD student at [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, fortunately advised by [Prof. Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I closely worked with [Prof. Yuesheng Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HBp_nuAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Peilin Zhao](https://peilinzhao.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

I write codes and papers about machine learning, especially focusing on machine learning research in the aspect of security and privacy. During my graduate study, I was a research intern at Tencent AI Lab and was supported by the Presidential Scholarship, which was the highest honor for PhD students at Peking University.
